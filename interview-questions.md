# ASSESSMENT 3: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.


1. What is `this` in JavaScript?

  Your answer: 'this' is  a way to call on or change value in a class

  Researched answer:  'this" is a javascript keyword that refers to the object or class it belongs to. The 'this' keyword can be used to reference the object it belongs to while creating new methods for the original object. 



2. What is React? Why would you use it?

  Your answer: React is a javascript library that is used to mount and run websites in a dynamic environment to aid with detecting errors and outputs in realtime as code is being written. 

  Researched answer: React is a component based Javascript library used to build front end website user interfaces. The componenets are independent, isolated, reusable peieces of the user interface. React can compose all of the componenets together to build complex user interfaces that "react" to user inputs in realtime. The react library is useful for seeing realtime accurate errors while programming and is useful when scaling a website for larger user bases. 



3. Which lifecycle method is required in a React class component?

  Your answer: Render is used to compose and reference all of the additional componenets that have been created. 

  Researched answer: The 'render ()' method is the only required method in a class component. When called it should examine 'this.props' and 'this.state' and return React elements, arrays and elements, portals, string and numbers, booleans or null type. 



4. What is JSX? What is one notable difference between HTML and JSX?

  Your answer: JSX is a slightly modified version of HTML that exists in a javascript react file. The notable difference is class tag is called className in JSX because javascript reads 'class' as a different keyword as part of the language. 

  Researched answer: JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript that behaves almost like HTML. JSX uses 'className' instead of HTML's 'class'. 



5. What is yarn? What file(s) are modified in a React application when you run yarn?

  Your answer: Yarn is a program / process that runs while working with react. Yarn acts as a local server to host the react application as it is being coded to see errors and realtime changes to the webpage. 

  Researched answer: Yarn is a javascript package manager that creates file structure of a react application and manages its dependencies. Yarn opens the react webpage and hosts it with your machine as the local server. 



6. STRETCH: What is an anonymous function in JavaScript?

  Your answer: That is a term I haven't heard before and would have to research.

  Researched answer: An anonymous function is as function without a name that is stored in a variable. Functions stored in variables do not need names because they are local in scope to that declared variable. 


## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

1. Conditional rendering: works the same way conditionals work in JavaScript. It encapsulates the behavior your need so you can render only some of them depending on the state of the app. 

2. Props: An argument for a function in react that that returns an object with data of a react element. It passes information from one react componenet to another, from parent to child. 

3. JavaScript Events: Javascript reacting to a user doing something on an HTML element. React using JSX has slightly different syntax than HTML for events, onclick becomes onClick. 

4. Object oriented programming: Encapsulating a group of related variables and functions into an object. The variables are referred to as properties and fucntions as methods. OOP uses abstraction to hide processes from the main code by encapsulating functions and parameters inside of the objects. OOP also utilises inheritance to keep from having to redundantly re-write code for similar prcesses. 

5. Ruby: A backend OOP language used for server programming.
